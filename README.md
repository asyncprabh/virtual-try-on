Virtual Try-On (VTON)
📌 Overview

The Virtual Try-On (VTON) Project is an AI-powered fashion try-on system built with Python.
It enables users to upload their photos and try different clothes virtually using computer vision and body tracking techniques.
The project leverages deep learning, NumPy, and image processing to warp garments onto the user’s body while maintaining natural alignment.

🚀 Features

👤 Body & Pose Tracking – Detects human body landmarks using tools like MediaPipe / OpenPose.

👕 Virtual Try-On – Warps and overlays selected clothing items on user images.

🔢 AI-Powered Fitting – Adjusts garment size using body measurement estimation.

🖼️ Image Preprocessing – Background removal, alignment, and resizing for realistic output.

🗄️ SQLite Database Integration – Stores user details, clothing metadata, and try-on history with Python’s built-in lightweight database.

🔮 Future Scope – Integration with live camera feed for real-time try-on.
